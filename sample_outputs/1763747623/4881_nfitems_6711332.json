A former department chair and 20-year associate editor of The Journal of Organic Chemistry, Dave has also consulted for major pharmaceutical companies including Merck, Pfizer, and Amgen.

He’s also coached collegiate gymnastics and taekwondo and has been featured in outlets like The Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone, and The Federalist but usually on topics far removed from chemistry.\n\n\n\nPaid partnerships with:\n\nDutch: Get $50 a year for vet care with Tucker50 at https://dutch.com/tucker\n\nLiberty Safe: Visit https://LibertySafe.com to find a dealer and learn more\n\nBeam: Get 30% off for a limited time using the code TUCKER at https://ShopBeam.com/Tucker\nLearn more about your ad choices.
