Branch: feature/consolidate-samples01

### Purpose
This log summarizes the key actions and changes performed by GitHub Copilot during the current session. It provides traceability of the automated assistance and a quick overview of what changed and why.

---

### Issues Addressed

1) Repository optimization: Consolidate sample files
- Issue: "The sample_inputs and sample_outputs are too many files, is there any reason they can not be compressed as 2 files and then decompressed when needed?"
- Solution summary:
  - Confirmed that sample directories (100+ files, 50MB total) were only referenced in documentation, not in code.
  - User compressed directories into `sample_inputs.tar.gz` and `sample_outputs.tar.gz`.
  - Updated `README.md` to reference compressed archives with extraction instructions.

---

### Code Changes Implemented During Session

- Updated: `README.md`
  - Modified "Sample data" section to reference compressed archives (`sample_inputs.tar.gz` and `sample_outputs.tar.gz`).
  - Added extraction instructions using `tar -xzf` commands.
  - Clarified that extracted files from `sample_inputs` can be moved to `inputs` for testing.

---

### Tests and Verification

- No build/test required (documentation-only change).

---

### Commands Executed

- grep_search: Searched for references to `sample_inputs` and `sample_outputs` in codebase.
- read_file: Read README.md to understand existing documentation.
- du -sh: Checked size of sample directories (21M and 29M respectively).
- replace_string_in_file: Updated README.md with new compressed archive instructions.

---

### Notes

- Sample directories were compressed prior to this session by the user.
- This change significantly reduces repository clutter from 100+ sample files to 2 compressed archives.
- Original directories remain in working tree; user may choose to remove them and commit only the archives.
